1) consecutive_days
    - need:
        - max consecutive days_count
        - start date for consecutive_days
        
2) auto-configuration
    - how to configure yaml
        - configure by page/class
        - variable names/special designation (using alias?)
        - look for a class 'attr_accessor'/varible presence in class
            - it's probably always to have an attr_accessor for any configurable data?
                - Question: does it make sense to create variables that can only be set through configuration files?
